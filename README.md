Introduction To C#

1) Project: When you create an app, website, plug-in, etc. in Visual Studio, you start with a project. In a logical sense, a project contains all the source code files, icons, images, data files, etc. that are compiled into an executable, library, or website. A project also contains compiler settings and other configuration files that might be needed by various services or components that your program communicates with.
2) Solution: A project is contained within a solution. Despite its name, a solution is not an "answer". It's simply a container for one or more related projects, along with build information, Visual Studio window settings, and any miscellaneous files that aren't associated with a particular project. A solution is described by a text file (extension .sln) with its own unique format; it's not intended to be edited by hand.

To Create a Projects inside solutions, right click the appropriate solution and add project in the Solutions Explorer. Morever, to commit the previous changes visit Team Explorer and click on change->commit->sync->push.
